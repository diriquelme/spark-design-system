# Button

Buttons allow users to trigger actions and make choices. A button's text
sets clear expectations of what action will occur when users interact with it.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--primary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Button Example"
/>

### Usage

Use buttons to communicate the different actions users can take and how they can interact with the page.

> As a general rule, use one main call to action ([Primary Button](#primary-button)) per screen.

- Use button types consistently across products.
- Avoid using too many buttons on a page.
- Use a [Link](/using-spark/components/link) when the action is to take the user to a new page or to an external site.

<SprkDivider element="span" additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"></SprkDivider>

## Variants

Buttons have different visual weights that help establish a visual hierarchy on a page.

- [Primary Button](#primary-button) (Filled)
- [Secondary Button](#secondary-button) (Outlined)
- [Tertiary Button](#tertiary-button) (Text button)
- [Compact Button](#compact-button)
- [Full Width Button](#full-width-button)

> Use one primary button as the main call to action to establish the
> button hierarchy on a screen.

### Primary Button

It represents the main action we want users to take on a screen. Filled buttons have the heaviest visual weight.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--primary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Primary Button Example"
/>

- Use in areas of high importance.
- Use one Primary (Filled) button per screen to help users understand the action hierarchy of the page and to avoid any confusion.
- For actions that help users navigate to the next step in a process.

**Exception**

For specific situations where users can choose between two journeys, two Primary (Filled) buttons may exist side by side.

### Secondary Button

It represents independent or alternative actions from the main call to action on
the screen. Outlined buttons have a medium visual weight and emphasis.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--secondary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Secondary Button Example"
/>

- There can be more than one on a screen.
- Use for alternative actions that do not navigate the user to the next step in a process.

### Tertiary Button

It represents the least important action on a screen. They have a similar visual style to a text [Link](/using-spark/components/link) and
have the lowest visual weight.

- For independent or less important actions.
- They can be used for sub-tasks where a Primary (Filled) button is the main action.
- In a button set, use Tertiary buttons for actions with the least visual emphasis that do not require the user's attention.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--tertiary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Tertiary Button Example"
/>

### Compact Buttons

A smaller version of regular sized buttons.

- All button types (Primary, Secondary and Tertiary) can be Compact buttons.
- Use in smaller viewports, like mobile screens.
- Do not mix with regular sized buttons.

### Full Width Buttons

Use full width buttons in containers that take up 1/3 of the grid or
smaller, like mobile screens.

- Button takes up the full width of it's container.
- On mobile screens, buttons can be stacked.
- When stacked, place the primary action on top of secondary actions.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--full-width-at-small-viewport"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Full Width at Smaller Viewports Button Example"
/>

## States

#### Disabled - Primary

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--disabled"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Disabled Button Example"
/>

#### Disabled - Secondary

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--disabled-secondary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Disabled Secondary Button Example"
/>

#### Disabled - Tertiary

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--disabled-tertiary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Disabled Tertiary Button Example"
/>

### Spinning

Use when data is being saved or submitted. The spinning indicator will replace the Button text.

#### Spinning - Primary

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--spinning"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Spinning Primary Button Example"
/>

#### Spinning - Secondary

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--spinning-secondary"
  hasHTML
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  titleAttr="Spinning Secondary Button Example"
/>

#### Spinning - Tertiary

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--spinning-tertiary"
  hasHTML
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  titleAttr="Spinning Tertiary Button Example"
/>

<SprkDivider element="span" additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"></SprkDivider>

## Button Groups

Buttons can be grouped with other buttons to establish a relationship between them.

- Group buttons based on their usage and importance.
- A max of two buttons should be in a group.
  - A Primary button can be grouped with any less visual weight (Secondary or Tertiary) buttons.
  - Do not mix a primary, secondary, and tertiary buttons in the same button group.
- Do not use too many buttons on a page to avoid overwhelming users.

**Exception**

For layouts that require more than three calls to action in a group.

- Use one Primary button for the main action in combination with two less visual weight buttons.
- Do not mix more than two styles of buttons.
- If using a primary button in the group, prefer all other buttons to be tertiary.

### Style Guidelines

#### Text Labels

- Button text should set clear expectations of what will happen when the user interacts with it.
- Always use title case (capitalize the first letter each word).
- Use task-specific action verbs like: "Add," Remove," Read Details," and "Submit."
- Use less than 20 characters.
- Use compact words. For example, instead of "Submit Your Information Now" use "Submit."
- Use first-person pronouns. Use "Customize My Loan," instead of "Customize Your Loan."
- Do not use ampersands (&).
- Do not wrap button text into a second line; it reduces legibility and starts looking less like an interactable element.

#### Button Styling

- Text should be center aligned.
- Buttons should have 16px of padding on the top and bottom, and 24px on the left and right sides.
- Width should be between 48x and 280px.
- Grouped buttons should be 16px away from each other.
- Apply the same width to all buttons in a group.
- Do not use buttons in paragraphs or within lines of text. Use
  [Link](/using-spark/components/link)
  instead.

#### Button Alignment

As a rule, place the (Primary) button **on the right side** of a screen
to communicate the main action and capture's the user's attention.

> This rule follows the Gutenberg's principle, which describes how a
> user's eye makes a z-pattern when scanning a screen and implies that
> placing buttons to the right communicates the main action to the user.

- Buttons should be right aligned to its parent container.
- On a Button group, place the main action **on the
  right** for the most important action.
- **Side by Side (Horizontal) buttons** - place the Primary (Filled) button **on the right** and all other actions to the left.
- **Stack (Vertical) buttons** - place the Primary (Filled) button **on top** of the secondary or tertiary action.

## Anatomy

- A Button must have a text label and/or icon, and a container.
- A Button's Text communicates the action that will happen when the
  user interacts with it.

## Accessibility

- If a Button only includes an Icon with no text, alternative text
  must be provided.
