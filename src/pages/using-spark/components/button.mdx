# Button

An interactive element that represents an action or choice.
Well written button text clearly communicates what action will occur when the user interacts with it.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--primary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Button Example"
/>

### Usage

Use Buttons to represent what type of actions the users can take on a page and to create a visual hierarchy between different calls to action.

> As a general rule, use no more than two primary call-to-action buttons ([Primary Button](#primary-button)) per page.

Examples of Button usage:
- To trigger action.
- To submit a form.
- To begin a new task.
- To navigate to the next step in a process.
- To confirm completion or to exit out of a flow.

If the action will take the user to a new page or to an external site, consider using a [Link](/using-spark/components/link) instead.

### Guidelines

#### How to Write Effective Button Text
- Button text should set clear expectations as to what will happen when activated.
- Use title case (capitalize the first letter each word).
- Use task-specific action verbs like: “Add”, “Remove”, “Read Details”, and “Submit”.
- Use less than 20 characters.
- Use compact words. For example, instead of “Submit Your Information Now” use “Submit”.
- Use first-person pronouns. Use “Customize My Loan,” instead of “Customize Your Loan.”
- Do not use ampersands (&).
- Do not wrap button text into a second line; it reduces legibility, and starts looking less like an interactable element.

#### Button Styling
- Text should be center aligned.
- Buttons should have 16px of padding on the top and bottom, and 24px on the left and right sides.
- Width should be between 48px and 280px.
- Grouped buttons should be 16px away from each other.
- Do not use buttons in paragraphs or within lines of text. Use [Link](/using-spark/components/link) instead.

#### Full Width at Smaller Viewports
At small viewport sizes, a Button may be full width.
- Stacked Buttons should have the primary action above secondary actions.
- Use full width Buttons in containers that take up 1/3 of the grid or smaller.

<SprkDivider
 element="span"
 additionalClasses="sprk-u-Measure"
></SprkDivider>

## Variants

Use Button variants to emphasize different actions within a page.

> Variant names imply the order within action hierarchy, but they do not imply the **visual** placement on the page.

- [Primary Button](#primary-button)
- [Secondary Button](#secondary-button)
- [Tertiary Button](#tertiary-button)

### Primary Button

Represents the main call to action on the page. Use no more than two Primary Buttons per page.

> When there are multiple buttons, use the Primary Button to indicate the main action.

#### Examples
- Submit Application
- Apply to Buy a Home
- Apply for Refinance
- In a multi-step form, a Primary Button works with Secondary and Tertiary Button as a set of related actions.
  - **Primary Button is "Submit"**
  - Secondary Button is "Back"
  - Tertiary Button is "Cancel"

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--primary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Primary Button Example"
/>

### Secondary Button

Represents the second-highest priority action, following the Primary Button. There can be more than one on a page.

#### Examples
- Preview
- Save For Later
- Back
- In a multi-step form, a Secondary Button works with Primary and Tertiary Button as a set of related actions.
  - Primary Button is "Submit"
  - **Secondary Button is "Back"**
  - Tertiary Button is "Cancel"

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--secondary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Secondary Button Example"
/>

### Tertiary Button
Represents less prominent actions. Sometimes in an action set with [Primary](#primary-button) and [Secondary](#secondary-button) Buttons, but they can also be independent actions.

#### Example
- In a multi-step form, a Tertiary Button works with Primary and Secondary Button as a set of related actions.
  - Primary Button is "Submit"
  - Secondary Button is "Back"
  - **Tertiary Button is "Cancel"**

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--tertiary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Tertiary Button Example"
/>

## States

### Disabled

Represents an action that’s not currently available to the user. It implies that the Button would be available given a certain set of circumstances.

Since a user can’t interact with this Button, consider if it’s necessary to show it at all.

#### Disabled - Primary
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--disabled"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Disabled Button Example"
/>

#### Disabled - Secondary
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--disabled-secondary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Disabled Secondary Button Example"
/>

#### Disabled - Tertiary
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--disabled-tertiary"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Disabled Tertiary Button Example"
/>

### Spinning

Use when data is being saved or submitted. The spinning indicator will replace the Button text.

#### Spinning - Primary
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--spinning"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Spinning Primary Button Example"
/>

#### Spinning - Secondary
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--spinning-secondary"
  hasHTML
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  titleAttr="Spinning Secondary Button Example"
/>

#### Spinning - Tertiary
<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--spinning-tertiary"
  hasHTML
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  titleAttr="Spinning Tertiary Button Example"
/>


### Full Width at Smaller Viewports

At small viewport sizes, a Button may be used at full width.

- Stacked Buttons should have the primary action above secondary actions.
- Use full width Buttons in containers that take up 1/3 of the grid or smaller.

<ComponentPreview
  componentName="button--full-width-at-small-viewport"
  hasReact
  hasAngular
  hasHTML
  titleAttr="Full Width at Smaller Viewports Button Example"
/>

## Anatomy

- A Button must contain text and/or an Icon

## Accessibility
- If a Button only includes an Icon with no
text, alternative text must be provided.
