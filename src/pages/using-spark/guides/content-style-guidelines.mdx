## Capitalization

Use for visual presentation of pieces of text to make it easy for users to read.

### Sentence Case

Sentence case capitalizes the first word of the sentence and proper nouns.

#### Usage

- For headers that are meant to be emotional or impactful.
- For special instances, where there may be two primary headers on a page.
- For body copy.
- For email subject lines and pre-headers.
- For list items. Use end punctuation only when the list item is a complete sentence.

##### Examples:

- We’re here to help!
- If you want the lowest payment possible, you might want to look at a 30-year fixed.
- Lock your rate and save.
- Interest rates are on the rise.
- Welcome to Rocket Mortgage.

### Start Case

Use this case style to capitalize the first letter of each word, regardless of length or part of speech. When using title case, avoid using end punctuation other than question marks.

#### Usage

- For headers that are descriptive or functional.
- For all subheads regardless of whether the primary header is title or sentence case
- For all buttons labels (Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Buttons.)
- For menu items.
- For chart and table headers.
- To refer the name of a page.

##### Examples

- Homeowners Insurance Info.
- How To Buy A Home.
- Lock Your Rate And Save.
- Check Your To Do List.

> Use either start or sentence case for items like headers, drop down options and labels, depending on the context.

## Quotation Marks

Use opening and closing quotes to show the start and endpoint of quoted content.

#### Usage

- For quoting someone’s words, use double quotes.
- Don’t use quotation marks when citing the full name of an online article within an interface.
