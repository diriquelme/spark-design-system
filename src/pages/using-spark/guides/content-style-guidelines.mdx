## Capitalization

Use for visual presentation of pieces of text to make it easy for users to read.

### Start Case

Use this case style to capitalize the first letter of each word, regardless of length or part of speech. When using start case, avoid using end punctuation other than question marks.

#### Usage

Use for:

- Headers that are descriptive or functional
- All subheads regardless of whether the primary header is title or sentence case
- All buttons labels (Primary, Secondary and Tertiary Buttons)
- Menu items
- Chart and table headers
- Referring to the name of a page

  Examples:
</h4>

- Homeowners Insurance Info
- How To Buy A Home
- Lock Your Rate And Save
- Check Your To Do List

### Sentence Case

Sentence case capitalizes the first word of the sentence and proper nouns.

#### Usage

Use for:

- Emotional and Impactful headers
- Special instances, where there may be two primary headers on a page
- Body copy
- Email subject lines and pre-headers
- List items, use end punctuation only when the list item is a complete sentence

<h4 class=" docs-b-h4 sprk-b-TypeDisplayFive sprk-u-mbm sprk-u-Measure ">
  Examples:
</h4>

- We’re here to help!
- If you want the lowest payment possible, you might want to look at a 30-year fixed.
- Lock your rate and save.
- Interest rates are on the rise.
- Welcome to Rocket Mortgage.

> As a general rule, use **Start case** for **Headers**, use either **Start** or **Sentence case** for drop down options and labels, depending on the context.

## Quotation Marks

Use opening and closing quotes to show the start and endpoint of quoted content.

#### Usage

- For quoting someone’s words, use double quotes.
- Don’t use quotation marks when citing the full name of an online article within an interface.

<h4 class=" docs-b-h4 sprk-b-TypeDisplayFive sprk-u-mbm sprk-u-Measure ">
  Examples:
</h4>
