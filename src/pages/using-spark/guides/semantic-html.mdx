  Writing Meaningful Web Content with Semantic HTML
</SprkHeading>

Typically, in a word document, writers bold or italicize text to add context to the copy.

When producing web content, the context and structure are defined by a page’s HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language).

  Main Takeaways
</SprkHeading>

- Use HTML elements to define the meaning, structure, or style of a word, line, or any piece of text.
- Know and understand the purpose of each HTML tag.
- Ensure content is accessible to assistive technologies by choosing the correct tag.

  HTML Tags Usage
</SprkHeading>

Use tags to clearly describe their meaning and content to browsers, developers and
users of assistive technologies.

> As a UX Writer, it’s important to know and understand the **purpose** of each **HTML tag** to ensure the **intended meaning** is communicated and to know when to use them.

Common HTML tags are the **Strong** `strong` and the **Emphasis** `em` tags.

- Use these tags to ensure users can perceive the semantic meaning indicated by the visual treatment, even if they’re using assistive technology like a screen reader.

- Don’t use the **Bold** `bold` or **Italic** `italic` tags for emphasizing text. These don’t add meaning to the copy, and they aren’t accessible for screen readers.

  Strong Text
</SprkHeading>

The `<strong>Strong Tag</strong>` indicates that its contents have strong importance, seriousness, or urgency.

#### Usage

- To reference the name of a page.
- To emphasize text, like a word or a phrase.
- Use for content that is of greater importance.
- Don’t use the Bold tag to emphasize text. Use the Bold tag to draw attention to text without indicating that it's more important.
