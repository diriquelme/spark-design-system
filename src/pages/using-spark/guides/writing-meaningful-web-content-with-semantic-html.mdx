  Writing Meaningful Web Content with Semantic HTML
</SprkHeading>

Typically, in a word document, writers **bold** or <em>italicize</em> text to add **emphasis** to the copy.

When producing web content, the **structure** and **meaning** are defined by a page’s HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language).

> HTML is made up of **elements**, which when applied they give **structure** to content and can **add different meaning** to pieces of text.

### Main Takeaways

- Use HTML elements to define the structure and meaning of a web page's content.
- Know the purpose of each element to understand when to use it and to ensure the content can be access by assistive technologies.
- Use the correct element to ensure the content communicates the intended meaning.

### Benefits Of Using Semantic HTML

- **It's easier to develop**. It gives content structure making it easier to understand.
- **It's better for mobile experiences**. Semantic HTML is lighter in file size, and easier to make responsive.
- **It's good for SEO**. It makes documents more findable, search engines give more importance to keywords inside the content structure.

  HTML Elements
</SprkHeading>

An **element** is created by enclosing pieces of text using **tags**. Elements describe the meaning and content to web browsers, developers and users of assistive technologies.

> As a UX Writer, it's important to **understand** each HTML element's **usage** and **purpose** to know when to use them, and ensure the content is communicating the **intended meaning**.

The most common HTML elements for UX Writer's are:

- The **strong element** `<strong></strong>`, defines text with strong importance.
- The **emphasis element** `<em></em>`, defines text emphasis.

Using these elements ensure users can perceive the semantic meaning indicated by the visual treatment, even if they’re using assistive technology like a screen reader.

### HTML Formatting Elements

Use the bold and italic elements to display special types of text.

- The `<b>bold</b>` element to bold text without extra importance.

- The `<i>italic</i>` element defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood. The content inside is typically displayed in italic.
  - Use for technical terms, a phrase from another language, a thought, a product name, etc.

> The intended meaning or purpose of the enclosed text should be what determines which element to use. For more information, visit <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element"> Modzilla's Developer Documentation - HTML elements </a>.

  Using The Strong Element
</SprkHeading>

The <strong>strong element</strong> indicates strong importance, seriousness, or urgency of the enclosed text inside the `<strong></strong>` tags.

By default web browsers, render the contents inside strong tags in **bold type**.

#### Usage

- To reference the name of a page.
- To represent strong importance of it's contents.
- To add importance or urgency to pieces of a sentence.

  Examples
</SprkHeading>

These are some examples of emphasized word(s) using the strong element.

- Check your **To Do List** items for new tasks.
  - Check your `<strong> To Do List </strong>` items for new tasks.
- You can change your communication preferences on **My Profile**.
  - You can change your communication preferences on `<strong>My Profile</strong>`.
- **Your payment is due** on September 22, 2021.
  - `<strong>Your payment is due</strong>` on September 22, 2021.
- Remember to bring your **driver’s license** to your closing appointment.
  - Remember to bring your `<strong>driver’s license</strong>` to your closing appointment.

#### Strong vs Bold Element vs Styling Text

- Use the **strong element** `<strong></strong>` for important content, and to communicate urgency.
- Use the <b>bold element</b> `<b></b>` to bring attention to text without indicating that it's more important.
  - Use to draw the reader's attention to the elements contents, which aren't of special importance.
  - Use for **keywords** in a summary and for **product names** in a review.
  - **Don't** use the **bold element** for styling or decorating text.

> For **decorating** and **styling** text, use the **CSS** (Cascade Styling Sheet) <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight">font-weight</a> property.

  Stressing Emphasis
</SprkHeading>

Use the <strong>em element</strong> to give <em>stressed emphasis</em> to the enclosed text inside the `<em></em>` tags, in the same way verbal stress works.

By default, web browsers render the contents inside the emphasis tags as <em>italic type</em>.

A screen reader will pronounce the words inside the **em** element `<em></em>` tags with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

> As a UX Writer, is important to know when to apply **stress emphasis** to text, because it can **change the meaning** of the sentence.

#### Usage

- Use for words that have a stressed emphasis compared to surrounding text.
  - For example: Our family <em>loves</em> spending summers on the beach.
- Use to change the meaning of a sentence.
  - For example: We found the perfect house, let's put an offer <em>
    now
      </em>!
- To reference a specific instance of microcopy within the web page that users can take action on.
  - For example: <em>
    Find Brokers Near Me
      </em> to connect with a broker in your community.

  Examples
</SprkHeading>

Here are some examples using the em element to give stressed emphasis to some of text.

- Sort by <em>Submitted</em> to see the loans you’ve already completed.
  - Sort by `<em>Submitted</em>` to see the loans you’ve already completed.
- Select <em>I don’t have a preference </em> from the dropdown if you change your mind.
  - Select `<em>I don’t have a preference </em>` from the dropdown if you change your mind.

#### Emphasis vs The Idiomatic Text Element

- Use the **emphasis element** `<em></em>` to indicate stress emphasis.
- Use the **idiomatic text element** `<i></i>` for text that is set off from the normal prose, like an alternate tone or mood.
  - Use for technical terms, transliterations and taxonomical designations (for example: "Homo Sapiens").
