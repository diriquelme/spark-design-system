  Writing Meaningful Web Content with Semantic HTML
</SprkHeading>

Typically, in a word document, writers bold or italicize text to add emphasis to the copy.

When producing web content, **HTML** (Hyper Text Markup Language) **elements** define the structure, purpose and intended meaning of a page's web content.

  Main Takeaways
</SprkHeading>

- Use HTML elements to define the structure and meaning of a web page's content.
- Know the purpose of each element to understand when to use it and to ensure the content can be access by assistive technologies.
- Use the correct element to ensure the content communicates the intended meaning.

Here are some benefits of using semantic HTML

- **It's easier to develop**. It gives content structure making it easier to understand.
- **It's better for mobile experiences**. Semantic HTML is lighter in file size, and easier to make responsive.
- **It's good for SEO**. It makes documents more findable, search engines give more importance to keywords inside the content structure.

  HTML Elements
</SprkHeading>

HTML (Hyper Text Markup Language) consists of series of elements, which enclose, or wrap pieces of content they appear or act a certain way.

Elements describe or represent the meaning, structure, or style of a word, to:

- Web browsers
- Developers
- Users of assistive technologies

> For more information, visit <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element"> Modzilla's Developer Documentation - HTML elements</a>.

As a UX Writer, it's important to:

- **Understand** what is the purpose of the enclosed text.
- **Know** what element to use to use depending on the purpose of the text.
- **Ensure** we are communicating the intended meaning of the enclosed text to the users.

  Creating Elements Using Tags
</SprkHeading>

Use **tags** to create an element. Tags delimit the start and end of elements in the markup.

An element consists of three parts:

- The **opening tag** that represents the start of the paragraph element.
- The **content** enclosed inside the tags.
- The **closing tag** that represents where the element ends.

<span id="examples" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"></span>
<SprkHeading
  element="h5"
  additionalClasses="sprk-u-mbm sprk-u-Measure"
  variant="displayFive"

  Example
</SprkHeading>

`<p>` Download the Rocket Homes mobile application on your mobile device to start looking for your dream home.`</p>`

- The `<p>` represents the start of the paragraph element.
- The content is the enclosed text (<i>"Download the Rocket.... " </i>) inside the tags.
- The `</p>` represents where the element ends.

#### Common HTML Elements For UX Writers

Use the strong and emphasis elements, to ensure users can perceive the semantic meaning indicated by the visual treatment, even if they’re using assistive technology like a screen reader.

- The **strong element** `<strong></strong>`, defines text with strong importance.
- The **emphasis element** `<em></em>`, defines text with stressed emphasis.

> Use the **bold element** `<b></b>` and the **italic or idiomatic text element** `<i></i>` for formatting and to display special types of text.

- The **bold element** `<b></b>` , draws attention to the element's contents, without extra importance.

- The **italic or idiomatic text element** `<i></i>`, defines a part of text in an alternate voice or mood.

  Semantic Elements
</SprkHeading>

Using HTML Semantic elements ensure users can perceive the semantic meaning indicated by the visual treatment, even if they’re using assistive technology like a screen reader.

- [The Strong Element](#the-strong-element)
- [The Emphasis Element](#the-emphasis-element)

> To view a list of all the HTML elements available to add semantic meaning to copy, refer to [MDN’s Semantic element list](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element#inline_text_semantics).

### The Strong Element

The <strong>strong element</strong> indicates strong importance, seriousness, or urgency of the enclosed text inside the `<strong></strong>` tags.

- By default web browsers, render the contents inside strong tags in **bold type**.

#### Usage

Use for:

- Referencing the name of a page
- Representing strong importance of it's contents
- Adding importance or urgency to pieces of a sentence

<span id="examples" class="docs-b-Link--anchor"></span>
<SprkHeading
  element="h5"
  additionalClasses="sprk-u-mbm sprk-u-Measure"
  variant="displayFive"
>
  Examples
</SprkHeading>

Here are some examples of emphasized word(s) using the strong element.

- Check your **To Do List** items for new tasks.
  - Check your `<strong> To Do List </strong>` items for new tasks.
- You can change your communication preferences on **My Profile**.
  - You can change your communication preferences on `<strong>My Profile</strong>`.
- **Your payment is due** on September 22, 2021.
  - `<strong>Your payment is due</strong>` on September 22, 2021.
- Remember to bring your **driver’s license** to your closing appointment.
  - Remember to bring your `<strong>driver’s license</strong>` to your closing appointment.

#### The Strong vs The Bold Element vs Styling Text

- Use the **strong element** `<strong></strong>` for important content, and to communicate urgency.
- Use the <b>bold element</b> `<b></b>` to bring attention to text without indicating that it's more important.
  - Use for:
    - Drawing the reader's attention to the elements contents, which aren't of special importance
    - Keywords in a summary and for product names in a review
- Use **CSS** (Cascade Styling Sheet) to style or decorate text, like the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/font-weight"> font-weight style property.</a>

  The Emphasis Element
</SprkHeading>

Use the **emphasis** element to give "stressed emphasis" to the enclosed text inside the `<em></em>` tags, in the same way verbal stress works.

- By default, web browsers render the contents inside the emphasis tags as <i>italic type.</i>

- A screen reader will pronounce the words inside the **emphasis** element `<em></em>` tags with an emphasis, using verbal stress.

> As a UX Writer, is important to know when to apply **stress emphasis** to text, because it can **change the meaning** of the sentence.

#### Usage

Use for:

- Words that have a stressed emphasis compared to surrounding text.
  - For example: Our family <em>loves</em> spending summers on the beach.
- Changing the meaning of a sentence.
  - For example: We found the perfect house, let's put an offer <em>
    now
      </em>!
- Referencing a specific instance of microcopy within the web page that users can take action on.
  - For example: <em>
    Find Brokers Near Me
      </em> to connect with a broker in your community.

  Examples
</SprkHeading>

Here are some examples using the em element to give stressed emphasis to some of text.

- Sort by <em>Submitted</em> to see the loans you’ve already completed.
  - Sort by `<em>Submitted</em>` to see the loans you’ve already completed.
- Select <em>I don’t have a preference </em> from the dropdown if you change your mind.
  - Select `<em>I don’t have a preference </em>` from the dropdown if you change your mind.

#### The Emphasis vs Italic or Idiomatic Text Element

- Use the **emphasis element** `<em></em>` to indicate stress emphasis.
- Use the **italic or idiomatic text element** `<i></i>` for text that is set off from the normal prose, like an alternate tone or mood.
  - Use for:
    - Technical terms
    - Transliterations
    - Taxonomical designations, like: "Homo Sapiens"

## Accessibility

Use semantic HTML to ensure digital experiences are inclusive to all users and accessible by assistive technologies.
