  Main Takeaways
</SprkHeading>

Giving validation feedback is an emotional process. Support users with this process by following these guidelines:

- Explain what the Input expects before the user enters data. (Example: password rules, ranges, etc)
- Give clear and helpful feedback when encountering a problem.
- Use a combination of [placement](#placement), [timing](#timing), and [language](#language) to guide users through moments of uncertainty.

  Placement
</SprkHeading>

- Place messaging close to the Input. Spark places validation directly under the Input.
- Provide a clear visual to indicate something has gone wrong with user Input and needs attention.
- Plan error messaging for every field.
- On forms with multiple fields, show validation messaging for each Input field to guide users to a successful submission.

<SprkHeading element="h2" additionalClasses="sprk-u-mbm sprk-u-Measure" variant="displayThree">
  Timing
</SprkHeading>

- Show validation messaging after the user enters the data or when the Input becomes out of **selection focus**.
- On forms, show error messaging **before** the user submits the form.

> **Selection focus** changes when a user taps or clicks anywhere outside of the current focused element. Focus can also change
> through keyboard navigation.

  Language
</SprkHeading>

<ul>
  <li>
    Use labels and helper text to clarify what data the Input expects. Messaging should be related and relevant to the Input.
  </li>
  <li>
    Deliver direct and concise statement of the problem in non-technical terms. Write out abbreviations.
  </li>
  <li>
    Use sentence case. Do not use all caps.
  </li>
  <li>
    Direct users to the next action to solve the problem.
    <ul class="sprk-b-List sprk-b-List--indented sprk-u-Measure sprk-u-mvs">
      <li>
        Use positive action verbs, rather than negative ones. Focus on the solution by explaining what to do, opposed to what not to do.
      </li>
      <li>
        If the “error” is a system condition that blocks the user from accomplishing a task, offer them a way to be notified of updated system status.
      </li>
    </ul>
