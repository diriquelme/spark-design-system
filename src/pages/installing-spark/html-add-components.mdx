# Installing Spark in an HTML Project
## Adding Spark Components

Now you’re ready to start writing the HTML to build the structure
of the components you’ll be using. Here we’ll cover how to add
components for HTML, CSS and JavaScript environments with no
JavaScript framework. You can follow along with the code examples
in this guide using the sample app found in our <a href="https://github.com/sparkdesignsystem/spark-starter-html/" target="_blank">starter repository</a>.

This guide is Part 3 in a 3-Part series. You can also check out
[Part 1 - Setting Up Your Environment](/installing-spark/html-environment-setup) and
[Part 2 - Installation](/installing-spark/html-installation).

For instructions on setting up Spark in other environments, check out the
guides for [Angular](/installing-spark/angular) and [React](/installing-spark/react) development environments.

## Navigating to Component HTML

1. To get started, select the <a href="/using-spark" target="_blank">Using Spark</a>
tab at the top of this page. This is where you’ll find all the HTML you’ll
need for the component variants and configurations you can use.

2. Underneath the *Components* section in the left column, find the component
you want to add.

> **For example**: Let’s say you’re trying to add a Spinning Button. You’d
select the <a href="../using-spark/components/button" target="_blank">Button</a> component.

3. Click the *HTML* link to view the HTML documentation.

4. Navigate to the *Docs* tab at the top of the screen.

5. Scroll down until you see the component variant you would like to
include in your site.

6. Click *Show code*.

7. Copy the sample code into `index.html`.

> **For example**: If you’re adding a Spinning Button, you’d scroll
down on the Button page to find <a href="https://html.sparkdesignsystem.com/?path=/docs/components-button--spinning" target="_blank">Spinning Button</a>.
Then you’d copy the Spinning Button code that looks like this:

> **Note**: Make sure you’re including `main.js` after the HTML
elements in `index.html`. The `<script>` line should be at the
bottom of the `<body>` tag.

``` html
<button
  class="sprk-c-Button sprk-c-Button--has-spinner"
  data-sprk-spinner="click"
  data-id="button-spinner-1"
>
  Submit
</button>
```

> Our Storybook code shows the component in its active state. Making a button that
starts spinning requires additional engineering. The following is one example of implementation.

8. Add an `onclick` to the button that will run the Spark function. In this example,
we'll name the function `startSpinner()`
```
  <button class="sprk-c-Button" onclick="startSpinner()" data-id="button-spinner-1">
    Start Spinning
  </button>
```

9. In the `main.js` file, import `setSpinning` from Spark and create a `startSpinner` function.
```
import { setSpinning } from '@sparkdesignsystem/spark';

window.startSpinner = () => {
  const spinningButton = document.querySelector('[data-id="button-spinner-1"]');
  setSpinning(spinningButton, {});
}
```

10. You should see the component you just installed with all the
correct Spark CSS applied.

> **For example**: If you’ve added a Spinning Button
you’ll see something like this…

<div class="sprk-u-Measure">
  <img
    class="sprk-u-mbm"
    style="margin: auto; display: block;"
    src={spinnergif}
    alt="A Spark Button Spinner component."/>
</div>
